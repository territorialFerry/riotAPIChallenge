# Brainstorming Time

* On initial page, application will display a list of all the champs (Perhaps, allow search bar as well)
* Player can click on champion they want to learn about
* Player will be taken to a new page for that specific champion
* Changes occurred from patch 5.11 to 5.14 in the following items: Blasting Wand, Needlessly Large Rod, Rabadon's Deathcap, Zhonya's Hourglass, Luden's Echo, Rylai's Crystal Scepter, Archangel's Staff, Seraph's Embrace, Rod of Ages, Haunting Guise, Liandry's Torment, Void Staff, Nashor's Tooth, Will of the Ancients, Morellonomicon, Athene's Unholy Grail
* Whether a champion wins or loses a game, the champ will likely have instances where it used used the same items.
